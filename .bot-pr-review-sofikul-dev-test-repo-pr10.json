It will stringify the string and ignore the error object.\n\n**Suggestion:** Use template literals or string concatenation to properly format the error message: `console.error('Approve error:', error);`"

      "body": "Issue: The logic for handling 'REQUEST_CHANGES' and 'APPROVE' events is clear, but the code could be simplified by directly calling `submitReview` with the `event` variable, as the `approvePullRequest` function is already called within `submitReview` when the event is 'APPROVE'.\n\n**Suggestion:** Simplify the logic by directly calling `await submitReview(mapped, event);` without the conditional check for `event === 'REQUEST_CHANGES'`. Ensure `submitReview` handles both events appropriately."
