This could break compatibility with environments that do not support ES modules.\n\n**Suggestion:** Ensure that the environment supports ES modules before making this change, or provide a fallback for environments that use CommonJS."

If this file is used to store comments, initializing it with an empty array could lead to overwriting existing data without warning.\n\n**Suggestion:** Implement a check to ensure that the file is only initialized if it does not already exist, or if it is intended to clear previous comments."

It could clutter the output if not managed properly.\n\n**Suggestion:** Consider using a logging library with different log levels to manage such messages, or remove the statement if it is not needed for production."
