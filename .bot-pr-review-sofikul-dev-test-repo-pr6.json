If any of these are not set, it could lead to runtime errors or incorrect API calls.\n\n**Suggestion:** Add checks to ensure that REPO_OWNER, REPO_NAME, PR_NUMBER, and GITHUB_TOKEN are defined and not null before proceeding with the API call. If any are missing, throw an error or handle it gracefully."

      "body": "Issue: The GITHUB_TOKEN is directly used in the Authorization header without validation. If the token is invalid or expired, the request will fail.\n\n**Suggestion:** Before making the API call, validate the GITHUB_TOKEN to ensure it is not null or empty. Consider adding a retry mechanism or a specific error message if the token is invalid."

      "body": "Issue: Logging the error stack in the console might expose sensitive information, which can be a security risk.\n\n**Suggestion:** Consider logging only the error message or a user-friendly message. If detailed error information is needed for debugging, ensure it is logged securely and not exposed in production environments."
